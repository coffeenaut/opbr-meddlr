Information provided by the app is community-sourced from different online forums. Medal information is sourced from github repo MetaSharpNet and most Medal sets are by /u/romanpuss. The dashboard on the homepage displays medal sets aggregated from different online forums using their expertise and knowledge of the game. Sets found here are suggestions based around specific game mechanics such as 'damage' or 'skill 1 cooldown' and are categorized as such. Sets on the homepage can be filtered to these categories and clicking on a set will bring the set of medals to display on the medal platform.",homepageNote:"*all sets on the homepage are shown at random, each time the dashboard loads, new filters and sets will load.",build:"Medal building is one of the primary purposes of Meddlr and allows users to quickly find medals and drop their selected medals into a set for use on a character. When medals are dropped into one of the three medal slots, Meddlr will calculate matching medal criteria to display any applicable in-game traits when used on a character for the corresponding set of medals. Traits will automatically be limited to the in-game limits and will display red text when the limit is reached. Hovering over the extra trait value will show the total number (without limits). Character specific traits (e.g. When character is of type 'Straw Hat Pirates') may go over the limit for a trait may display incorrectly. It is up to the user to decide if the trait is valid; in-game traits applied may not be as rewarding.",drag:"Meddlr features a drag and drop function similar to in-game mechanics to give users intuitive interactivity when medal building. To begin, click (tap), hold, and drag a medal from the medal list.
